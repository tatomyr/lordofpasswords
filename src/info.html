        <p>
          It's safe to have a different password for each site or other service.
          And it's also good to have passwords that hard to guess but easy to
          remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's where the Password Generator comes in handy. You should only
          remember your masterpassword. Also you have to specify a memorable
          name for a site or service (for this site it probably could be
          'masterpassword'). Then the app do the rest - mix them both together,
          and ensures that you'll get the proper password format (e. g. with
          required number of different types of characters).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can access the Password Generator on desktop, on thablet or on
          your mobile. You can even kind of install it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then if you know which service you're trying to get access to, and
          remember your single masterpassword, you can always have your key
          using Password Generator.

          We don't make any calls over internet neither store user data, except
          of generated password length. This is storing locally in sake of
          user's convenience, so you don't need to enter the number each time.
          You can go completely offline and your app will continue working,
          because we don't rely on any kind of database.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the app code is available on
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/tatomyr/pw">Gitlab</a>. Also we don't
          minify nor uglify the app code so you can check it out using developer
          tools.
